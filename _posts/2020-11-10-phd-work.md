# My PhD work: level set methods and weird fluid flow in rocks

One of the biggest events in my recent life was getting a PhD, though it's already been two years ago now. While I had to write a rather long dissertation about it, I figured my personal website is a good place to talk about what I did - my resume is nowhere adequate.

## What was it about?

In a nutshell, I studied fluid flow in the pore spaces in rocks. Why is this important? Well, fluid flow in rocks crops up its head in a variety of circumstances - the one of most concern to me was oil, gas and water in large hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, the same principle applies in batteries, though the physics you worry about are quite different.

I mainly wrote a lot of simulation code for my research, though I did flirt with doing some experimental work - and quickly discovered I am not wired for it. 

## What problem did I try to solve?
