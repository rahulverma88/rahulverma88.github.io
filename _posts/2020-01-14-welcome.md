# Hello world

Hi! I'm Rahul, and this is my personal blog. I blog about a number of different interests, including but not limited to: machine learning, numerical computation, app building, geoscience-related resources, and visualization. I'm passionate about the impact data science has had on different fields of study, in particular, physics simulations and associated scientific research
